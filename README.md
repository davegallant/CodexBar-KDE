KDE Plasma 6 widget (plasmoid) that shows AI coding-provider limits from the
[CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) CLI as horizontal fuel gauges
that fill according to the quota remaining, with reset countdowns, pace
summaries, credits, and provider errors.

Available on the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/p/2365355).

Works both on the desktop and in a panel:

| Panel (compact) | Popup dark | Popup light |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![panel](docs/panel.png) | ![popup](docs/popup.png) | ![popup light](docs/popup-light.png) |

Settings — pick which coding agents to display:

## Requirements

- KDE Plasma 6 (`kpackagetool6`)
- [CodexBar CLI](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/releases) for Linux on
  `PATH` (or anywhere — the path is configurable). Quick install:

  ```bash
  curl -sL -o /tmp/codexbar.tar.gz \
    "$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/steipete/CodexBar/releases/latest \
       | grep -o '"browser_download_url": *"[^"]*linux-x86_64.tar.gz"' | cut -d'"' -f4)"
  mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && tar -xzf /tmp/codexbar.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin CodexBarCLI \
    && ln -sf ~/.local/bin/CodexBarCLI ~/.local/bin/codexbar
  codexbar --version
  ```

- At least one provider signed in (Codex/Claude CLI credentials are picked up
  automatically; see `codexbar config providers` for the full list).

## Install

### From the KDE Store (recommended)

Right-click a panel or the desktop → *Add Widgets…* → *Get New Widgets…* →
*Download New Plasma Widgets* → search for **CodexBar**, or grab the
`.plasmoid` from the [store page](https://store.kde.org/p/2365355) /
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/EvilFreelancer/CodexBar-KDE/releases)
and install it with `kpackagetool6 --type Plasma/Applet -i <file>.plasmoid`.

### From source

```bash
./install.sh     # install/update this checkout and restart Plasma Shell
# or use the individual package commands:
make install     # kpackagetool6 --type Plasma/Applet -i package
make upgrade     # push code changes to the installed copy
```

Then add the **CodexBar** widget to a panel or the desktop
(right-click panel/desktop → *Add Widgets…* → search "CodexBar").

## Settings

- **General** — path to the `codexbar` binary, refresh interval, pace lines
  on/off.
- **Providers** — checkbox list of all 58 CodexBar providers (Codex and
  Claude are pre-selected by default). With nothing
  selected the widget follows the providers enabled in the CodexBar CLI config
  (`~/.config/codexbar/config.json`, managed via
  `codexbar config enable --provider <id>`). Selecting providers here fetches
  each one explicitly (`codexbar usage --provider <id>`), independent of the
  CLI config.

## How it works

The widget shells out to `codexbar usage --format json --no-color` through the
Plasma "executable" data engine on a timer, parses the JSON payloads in
[parser.js](package/contents/code/parser.js), and renders:

- **Compact (panel)**: two stacked, fuel-gauge-style meters per provider.
  The top bar shows session quota remaining and the bottom bar shows weekly
  quota remaining. An unavailable lane keeps an empty track. No percentage is
  shown.
- **Full (popup/desktop)**: one card per provider with a horizontal meter for
  every rate window (Session/Weekly/Monthly plus named lanes such as Codex
  Spark or Code review), reset countdowns, pace summaries, account, plan,
  credits, status incidents, and error messages. Each meter fills according to
  the quota remaining; no usage percentages are displayed.
- **Cache + background refresh**: the last known numbers stay on screen while
  a refresh runs in the background and survive plasmashell restarts; the
  tooltip and popup header show when data was last updated. If a provider
  fetch fails, its cached card stays visible with a "showing data from …"
  note instead of blanking out.
- **Local token costs**: provider cards show today's and last-30-days spend
  in USD with token counts (from `codexbar cost`, Codex and Claude) plus a
  daily spend history chart. Both can be toggled off in the settings.
- **Proxy support**: an optional proxy URL (http/socks5) is exported as
  `http_proxy`/`https_proxy`/`ALL_PROXY` for every CLI call — handy when
  provider APIs are blocked in your region.

## Packaging for the KDE Store

```bash
make dist    # builds org.rpa.codexbar-v<version>.plasmoid (zip of package/)
```

The resulting `.plasmoid` file is what gets uploaded to
[store.kde.org](https://store.kde.org) (profile → *Add Product*, category
*KDE Plasma Extensions → Plasma Widgets*). `metadata.json` already carries
`"X-Plasma-API-Minimum-Version": "6.0"`, which is required for the widget to
show up in Plasma 6's *Get New Widgets* dialog.

## Development

```bash
node --test           # unit tests for parser.js (no Qt required)
make install          # install the plasmoid
plasmawindowed org.rpa.codexbar   # run windowed for a quick look
```

`package/contents/code/parser.js` is engine-neutral: QML imports it directly
and Node tests `require()` it, so all parsing/formatting logic is unit-tested.
